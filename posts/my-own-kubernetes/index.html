You can read about that <a href=/posts/migrating-from-cloud-foundry-to-kubernetes/>here</a>.</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t take long for problems and issues to start emerging. The cluster not being on exactly the version I wanted it to be, pre-installed components that didn&rsquo;t behave they way I wanted (nginx ingress controller for example), price hikes and occasional outages, not really a lot of insight into the behind the scenes of my cluster, etc.</p><p>Also, I was continuously adding and deploying more additional components onto the cluster, like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, etc.. The resource requirements kept creeping upwards, I had to add more nodes (or beef-up the existing ones), which again meant further cost increases than anticipated.</p><p>At some point I was simply too fed up with the lack of direct control I had over this situation and bit the bullet: It&rsquo;s time to deploy and manage my own K8s cluster! After all, I&rsquo;m a relentless DevOps engineer.. 😎</p><p>To install and manage your own Kubernetes cluster you will need some (well, at least one) VMs. Now, where can I find some of these?</p><h2 id=hetzner-cloud>Hetzner Cloud</h2><p>While looking for the ideal place to host my Kubernetes cluster I was going through all of the usual cloud providers to see which one would fit my use case best.</p><p>The 3 big ones are just way too expensive to host VMs with my small-ish vCPU and RAM requirements (I was looking for something with around 4+ vCPUs and 8GB RAM), so that&rsquo;s a no-go.
DigitalOcean, Linode and Vultr were still a bit too pricey for my taste, I really didn&rsquo;t care too much about performance. The most important factor really was just how much RAM does the VM have, as that will determine what K8s deployments and pods, etc. I can cram onto the cluster at once. 4 vCPUs and 8GB RAM was around $50 per month on these, that was still more than I was willing to pay.</p><p>The winner in the end was <a href=https://www.hetzner.com/cloud>Hetzner Cloud</a>. They offer such a 4/8 VM for as low as $15 per month.
This turned out to be so cheap that I actually ended up choosing a much beefier VM, the CPX41, which has 8 vCPUs and 16GB of RAM for just $28 per month. Wow! 😲</p><p>Looking through all the features of Hetzner Cloud I saw that they also provide all the other things I might need for my Kubernetes cluster. They&rsquo;ve got attachable, persistent block storage volumes for their VMs and provide a Kubernetes <a href=https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver>CSI driver</a> for them. They&rsquo;ve got Floating IPs I can attach to VMs (to have a persistent IP thats decoupled from the VMs lifecycle), HTTP(S)/TLS Load Balancers (I don&rsquo;t need one but the fact it&rsquo;s available is a big plus!), custom private networks for my VMs, configurable firewalls, and everything fully accessible via an <a href=https://developers.hetzner.com/cloud/>API</a> (with Terraform plugins available for it) or the handy hcloud<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> CLI.</p><p>A bit of googling revealed that I seem to be not the only one making that choice, there&rsquo;s loads of projects and tools out there that provision Kubernetes on Hetzner Cloud one way or another.</p><p>In the end my setup ended up rather simple:</p><ul><li>Provision a CPX41 VM</li><li>Attach a Floating IP to it</li><li>Configure my DNS entries to point to said IP</li><li>Configure the Hetzner Cloud Firewall for the VM</li><li>&mldr; aaaand that&rsquo;s it. Nothing else left to do here.</li></ul><h2 id=k3s>K3s</h2><p>Now, how do we install and setup Kubernetes on this VM? What &ldquo;<em>distribution</em>&rdquo; do we want to use?</p><p>Using plain <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/><code>kubeadm</code></a> would be way too cumbersome, I certainly did not want to invest that much time in setting up my cluster and having to maintain and babysit it on such a low level.</p><p><a href=https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/>Minikube</a> or <a href=https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/>kind</a>? Nope. These are fantastic tools for local K8s development, but I do not want to use them for running a production cluster (and neither should you!). <a href=https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/>kOps</a>? Meh, tries to do too many things at once while still being quite fiddly.</p><p><a href=https://microk8s.io/>MicroK8s</a>? Hmm, now we&rsquo;re getting closer. MicroK8s ticks a lot of the right boxes, but it is from Canonical and unfortunately distributed as a Snap install, and that&rsquo;s something that can go burn in hell! 🔥</p><p>In the end it was a showdown between <a href=https://k0sproject.io/>K0s</a> and <a href=https://k3s.io/>K3s</a>, both being very similar to each other and focused on small, self-contained single binaries with low resource usage. I went with K3s, because ultimately it had an edge in terms resource consumption and usability. Plus I&rsquo;m fond of Rancher Labs products, so that was a plus already.</p><p>So what is <a href=https://k3s.io/><strong>K3s</strong></a>?</p><blockquote><p><em>K3s is a lightweight, CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution created by Rancher Labs, that is highly available and designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. It is built and packaged into a single small binary with low resource requirements and very easy to install, run and auto-update a production-grade Kubernetes cluster with.</em></p></blockquote><p>In short, it is exactly what I need, perfect for my use case! Especially the low resource requirements make it perfect for my purpose, after all the single VM I&rsquo;m going to use will not be super large and powerful, I only need to run some of the usual suspects (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, etc.) plus my own applications on that Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>Installing K3s turned out to be as simple as running this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io <span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>|</span> <span style=color:#4e9a06>\

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using the installation script, it will install K3s as a systemd service and start it. If the service already exists it will update if necessary and check if it is running.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve explicitely specified and pinned the Kubernetes version that I want via <code>$INSTALL_K3S_VERSION</code> environment variable, and also disabled the default installation of Traefik and Klipper through <code>$INSTALL_K3S_EXEC</code> and <code>--disable</code>. These and many more options are all described in the excellent <a href=https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/>K3s documentation</a>.</p><p>The reason for disabling those two components was that I intend to use the much simpler and more common <a href=https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/>Ingress-NGINX</a> as my ingress controller instead of Traefik, and also have no need for Load Balancer support since I&rsquo;m going to deploy Ingress-NGINX with <strong>hostPort</strong>&rsquo;s 80 and 443 assigned to it directly. After all it is only a single VM Kubernetes &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=batteries-included->Batteries included? 🔋</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve got our cluster up and running! But what now?
The problem is that plain Kubernetes alone is not really useful yet and still a far cry away from a PaaS like Cloud Foundry. 🤷</p><p>This is where the &ldquo;Batteries included&rdquo; part comes into play.</p><p>To turn this Kubernetes cluster into something more of a PaaS we will need to add and deploy several more components, to have things like <strong>route and certificate management</strong>, <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>log collection</strong>, <strong>databases</strong>, <strong>dashboards</strong>, <strong>monitoring and alerting</strong>, etc.. Kubernetes unfortunately does not provide any of these things out of the box, you&rsquo;re on your own.</p><p>Now this is where the real work happens. I had to spend quite a bit of effort in figuring out the best way to solve each of these problems, and integrate everything together into one coherent solution.</p><p>Another thing at this point was that I also wanted to have the whole installation of K3s onto the Hetzner Cloud VM and even provisioning the VM to be completely automated and reproducible, if I ever need to spin up a new or another cluster quickly.</p><p>The result is this: <a href=https://github.com/JamesClonk/k8s-infrastructure>https://github.com/JamesClonk/k8s-infrastructure</a></p><h3 id=my-kubernetes-infrastructure-repositoryhttpsgithubcomjamesclonkk8s-infrastructure><a href=https://github.com/JamesClonk/k8s-infrastructure>My Kubernetes infrastructure repository</a></h3><p><img src=https://github.com/JamesClonk/k8s-infrastructure/raw/master/docs/architecture.png alt=Architecture></p><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to install the following additional <em>system components</em> onto my Kubernetes cluster, to turn it into a PaaS-like experience:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>URL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver>Hetzner Cloud CSI driver</a></td><td>Kubernetes Container Storage Interface driver for Hetzner Cloud Volumes</td><td><a href=https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver>https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx>NGINX Ingress Controller</a></td><td>An Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer</td><td><a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx>https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/>oauth2-proxy</a></td><td>A proxy that provides authentication with Google, Azure, OpenID Connect and many more identity providers</td><td><a href=https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy>https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://cert-manager.io>cert-manager</a></td><td>Automatic certificate management on top of Kubernetes, using <a href=https://letsencrypt.org>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a></td><td><a href=https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager>https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard>Kubernetes Dashboard</a></td><td>General-purpose web UI for Kubernetes clusters</td><td><a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard>https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics>kube-state-metrics</a></td><td>Add-on agent to generate and expose cluster-level metrics</td><td><a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics>https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://prometheus.io>Prometheus</a></td><td>Monitoring & alerting system, and time series database for metrics</td><td><a href=https://github.com/prometheus>https://github.com/prometheus</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://grafana.com/oss/loki>Loki</a></td><td>A horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system</td><td><a href=https://github.com/grafana/loki>https://github.com/grafana/loki</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://grafana.com/grafana>Grafana</a></td><td>Monitoring and metric analytics & dashboards for Prometheus and Loki</td><td><a href=https://github.com/grafana/grafana>https://github.com/grafana/grafana</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://www.postgresql.org>PostgreSQL</a></td><td>The world&rsquo;s most advanced open source relational database</td><td><a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs>https://www.postgresql.org/docs</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I&rsquo;ve added each of these components vendored with vendir<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> into a subdirectory in the main k8s-infrastructure repository, containing upstream deployment templates (be it a Helm chart, kustomize templates, release.yaml&rsquo;s, or in whatever other format the component is made available by its maintainers).</p><p>Each of them has its own <code>deploy.sh</code> shellscript, which uses the vendired upstream templates together with additional ytt<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> overlay templates to deploy against Kubernetes with kapp<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>. Whenever I want to deploy let&rsquo;s say for example <code>oauth2-proxy</code>, all I need to do is go into that directoy and run the shellscript.</p><p>The idea behind this is that it must be entirely reproducable and idempotent, I want to be able to re-run the <code>deploy.sh</code> as often as I like and it should just do its thing and ensure the same components with the same configuration get applied to the cluster each time as expected.</p><p>After all of these components are installed, it allows me to focus on the actual applications I want to develop and run &ldquo;<em>in the cloud</em>&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s assume I have a simple website app, what I now can do to deploy and run it on my cluster is this:</p><ul><li>define a K8s <strong>Deployment</strong> and <strong>Service</strong> resource for my app container / image</li><li>define a K8s <strong>Ingress</strong> resource</li></ul><p>And that&rsquo;s it. The Deployment and Service are as per usual, but the magic happens thanks to the Ingress. The Ingress resource will instruct the ingress-nginx controller to create and handle all traffic for a &ldquo;route&rdquo;, for example ht<span>tps://</span>my-app.my-k8s-cluster.com, and cert-manager will automatically issue a <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificate</a> for it. Also thanks to oauth2-proxy all I need to do is add a specific annotation on the Ingress resource to instruct the ingress controller to redirect all traffic for this particular route through oauth2-proxy, which will then in turn authenticate against my <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app>GitHub OAuth2 app</a> configuration.</p><p>It&rsquo;s still a lot more involved than a simple <code>cf push</code> on Cloud Foundry, but it&rsquo;s worlds apart from having to deal with just plain Kubernetes as an app developer.</p><p>With Prometheus and Alertmanager being installed on the cluster I&rsquo;ve now also got the benefit of being able to monitor everything with Grafana dashboards and set up automated alerts that ping me on Slack.</p><h2 id=automation-via-github-actions>Automation via GitHub Actions</h2><p>But why run a <code>deploy.sh</code> shellscript manually for all of these components if you can automate it, right? Same with installing or updating K3s on the Hetzner Cloud VM, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to do that myself. Let&rsquo;s automate everything with GitHub Actions! 😁</p><p>Since I&rsquo;ve already insisted on having everything fully scripted idempotently within shellscripts, and each component having its own set of them, I had no trouble turning this into GitHub Actions pipeline:</p><h5 id=githubworkflowspipelineyml>.github/workflows/pipeline.yml</h5><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#204a87;font-weight:700>name</span><span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>:</span><span style=color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline> </span><span style=color:#000>kubernetes production</span><span style=color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline>
