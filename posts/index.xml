My requirements for this have been the following:
Simple and easy to use (I hate complicated UI editors!) Preferably Markdown or similar format support Open source Self-hosted Easily runnable on my personal K8s cluster Tucked away behind an Ingress-Nginx controller, it must not try to do its own TLS / HTTPS handling Preferably no need for a database If it needs to have a database, then it must be Postgres (as that is what I already manage on my K8s infrastructure) Secure Preferably written in Golang PHP based software is out of the question by default!</description></item><item><title>Using a Service Broker in Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 11:23:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>OSBAPI? The Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) is a specification that defines a common language for service providers that your cloud native applications can use to manage cloud services without lockin.
OSBAPI allows independent software vendors, service providers and developers to easily integrate and consume services for workloads running on cloud native platforms such as the Swisscom Application Cloud, which is based on Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. The specification describes a simple set of API endpoints which can be used to provision, access and manage various service offerings, and has been adopted by many different platforms and thousands of service providers by now.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Foundry and Prometheus</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/cloud-foundry-and-prometheus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:40:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/cloud-foundry-and-prometheus/</guid><description>Where are my metrics? A Cloud Foundry story Loggregator The Loggregator in Cloud Foundry is the system behind the scenes that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for gathering and streaming logs and metrics about user apps. It also gathers and streams metrics from Cloud Foundry components itself and health metrics from other platform VMs. Loggregator allows you to view these logs and metrics either through the Loggregator CF-CLI plugins or through various third-party services and consumers, like for example the Cloud-Controller (API), a Firehose Nozzle or a Log-Cache endpoint.</description></item><item><title>My Tonkatsu Recipe</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/my-tonkatsu-recipe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 20:30:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/my-tonkatsu-recipe/</guid><description>This is neither a technical blog post, nor is it written in English, I know.
