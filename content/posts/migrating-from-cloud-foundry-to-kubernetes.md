>>>>>> #### TODO: developer.swisscom.com EOL, what now?
>>>>>> Heroku? too expensive
>>>>>> Other CF? IBM Bluemix? nope
>>>>>> AWS or GCP specific things? nope, don't want vendor lock-in!
>>>>>> K8s? hmmm.. maybe, but very complicated, not PaaS-like at all, requires a lot of initial effort, etc.
>>>>>> Managed K8s, but where? Scaleway! cheap and simple! includes ingress-nginx.
>>>>>> show old k8s-deployments repo, explain why adding to much stuff, to make it more CF-like

>>>>>> #### TODO: show old k8s-deployments repo here (deployed onto scaleway managed k8s, your own k8s will be shown later in my-own-kubernetes)
