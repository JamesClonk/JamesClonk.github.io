## WireGuard on Kubernetes

...
how to run: looked at many different images, *list*, ultimately decided on [masipcat/wireguard-go](https://github.com/masipcat/wireguard-go-docker), because its very simple and uncomplicated image, also directly provides a K8s example out of the box.

#### server.conf
```sh
# Server configuration
[Interface]
# The (internal) IP we want to give the VPN server itself
Address = 10.10.0.1/24

# The port the server should listen to, 51820 is the default for WireGuard
ListenPort = 51820

# The private key of the server
PrivateKey = 4N9FtwbtC9iY9P1C85l1QmM0OxlGRT0cHVjEuRbLuVA=

# Configure server private key and (de)initialize iptables rules for routing the VPN traffic
PostUp = wg set wg0 private-key /etc/wireguard/wg0.key && iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.10.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.10.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

# Don't try to save WireGuard config file on shutdown (it gets overwritten by Kubernetes anyway)
SaveConfig = false


# Configure one or multiple VPN clients with a [Peer] entry for each.
# For this example we only configure 1 client
[Peer]
# The public key of the client you want to let connect to the server
PublicKey = 8EiAxqTGhKFJeLhDDaZcuEVqpGJK1qrq8Ht299J7Q2o=

# The (internal) IP we want this client to have
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.5/32
```

As you can see from the server config example above we've chosen the network *`10.10.0.0/24`* to be our Wireguard VPN network. The server itself and all clients should be configured to IPs within that subnet. The server itself is defined as the gateway with *`10.10.0.1/24`*, and then for each client (peer) you configure a specific /32-IP in that subnet to be assigned. This IP will need to be reflected also in the client config file.

#### What are the benefits of doing this?

So at this point you might wonder why doing all of this in the first place, why would you run your own VPN server and DNS ad-blocker on the internet?

There's various reasons for running this on my Kubernetes cluster (besides it being a fun project to thinker with), but the two most important one are these:
- Secure network traffic in "foreign" networks, wifi, etc. for your phone
  - All traffic will go through the VPN connection and exit on your "trusted" Kubernetes cluster, instead of being at the mercy of whatever hotel Wi-Fi you are currently using with your phone for example.
- System-wide ad-blocking via DNS on Android!
  - Having a DNS server that does ad-blocking being used as the sole DNS for the VPN connection means that you automatically get a system-wide ad-blocker for your Android phone. No more pesky ads in the browser or even within any apps themselves!

Let's get started on a client configuration file for your phone:

#### client.conf
```sh
# Client configuration
[Interface]
# Assign the IP as configured on the server config for this peer
Address = 10.10.0.5/32

# The private key of this client (its corresponding public key is in the server config for this peer)
PrivateKey = wMq8AvPsaJSTaFEnwv+J535BGZZ4eWybs5x31r7bhGA=

# DNS server the VPN client should use once connected.
# In our case this is the ClusterIP of our AdGuard Home Kubernetes service
DNS = 10.0.15.31


# The VPN server we want to connect to
[Peer]
# The public key of the server you want to connect to
PublicKey = uJ0bUIe8Kc+vp27sJVDLH8lAmo4E3dfGtzRvOAGQZ0U=

# The IP that points to our WireGuard pod on Kubernetes, could be a K8s LoadBalancer IP, ClusterIP, etc..
# In our case it is the node IP directly as we used a NodePort
Endpoint = 1.2.3.4:31820

# What IPs/subnet should be routed through the VPN? Use "0.0.0.0/0, ::/0" for all traffic
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

# Keep the connection alive through NAT and firewalls by sending a keepalive packet every 25 seconds
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

As you can see in the example above with the *`DNS`* entry we've defined which DNS server should be used by the client once the VPN connection is established. In this case it is the IP under which our AdGuard Home DNS server is reachable, and thus we have now DNS-based ad-blocking automatically included for all our VPN traffic/connections.

### qrencode

Once we have the client config file ready our next step is to import it into the [WireGuard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android) on your phone.

The easiest way to do this is via QR-code. We'll install **`qrencode`** for this:

```sh
# pacman -S qrencode

```

Now let's use it to generate a QR-code picture of our config file, displaying it either directly in the terminal:
```sh
$ qrencode -t ANSIUTF8 -r client.conf
[QR CODE in terminal]
```

Or by writing it to a PNG file to display:
```sh
$ qrencode -t PNG -r client.conf -o client_conf.png
```

Simply scan the resulting QR-code with the WireGuard app on your phone to import the client configuration.

After importing you can then connect to the VPN and enjoy an ad-free internet experience on your whole Android phone, be it in the browser or inside apps! ðŸ˜ƒ

WireGuard is *very fast*, stable and also handles reconnects gracefully, allowing you to basically have the VPN connection open 24/7.
