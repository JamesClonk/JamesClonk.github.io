## Jira

Probably everybody knows or has heard of [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) before.

Jira is commonly used as a tool for issue, epics, stories and bug tracking and agile project management in general, developed by Atlassian, and can be installed and run on-premises or consumed as a Cloud Software-as-a-Service product.
At the company I work at ([Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/business/enterprise/angebot/cloud/cloudservices/application-cloud.html)) we also use Jira internally for all those use cases.

But dealing with the web UI can be very cumbersome and slow, everytime I have to update my tasks or stories and modify their current state I keep rolling my eyes at the general slowness of the whole procedure. ðŸ™„

That's where [TurboJira](https://github.com/JamesClonk/turbojira) comes into the picture! ðŸ˜„

## TurboJira

TurboJira is a very simple Android app that I wrote for myself to very specifically serve my exact uses cases of being able to:
- quickly list my own tasks / stories
- update / change their current state
- edit their description / summary
- create new tasks / stories with via a 1-click button

That's it, that's all it does. Very simple, but supremely effective. The UI has been fine-tuned to make it as fast and convient as possible for me to perform these tasks on my phone.

You can get the latest versions from here: https://github.com/JamesClonk/turbojira/releases.
All releases are available as Android APK files for direct installation on your phone (I stopped bothering with Google Play Store)
