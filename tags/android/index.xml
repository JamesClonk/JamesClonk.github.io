Jira is commonly used as a tool for issue, epics, stories and bug tracking and agile project management in general, developed by Atlassian, and can be installed and run on-premises or consumed as a Cloud Software-as-a-Service product. At the company I work at (Swisscom) we also use Jira internally for all those use cases.
