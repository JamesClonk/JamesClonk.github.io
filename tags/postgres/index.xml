So when I started pushing my applications onto the Swisscom Application Cloud and attaching Postgres databases to them (hosted by ElephantSQL), I needed a way to ensure there will always be backups, that they are under my control and supervision and hosted externally / off-site from the Postgres-provider itself, preferably on an S3 object store.</description></item></channel></rss>
