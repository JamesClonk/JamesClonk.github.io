Sim-racing is short for &amp;ldquo;simulated racing&amp;rdquo;. Basically it means you are using racing simulator software to try and simulate real world racing as accurately as possible. This includes all the real-world variables such as fuel usage, damage to the car, tire wear, grip, suspension settings, etc., which is unlike the more well-known arcade racing games like Forza Motorsport or Gran Turismo. The goal is to provide the most realistic depiction of real world racing as much as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
