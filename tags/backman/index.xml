I mentioned Backman already once in a previous post, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s an application for managing database backups. Backman can be deployed on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes and automatically detects and configures your databases through bindings, creates backups and stores these on an S3-compatible object storage. Backups can later be restored on-demand or downloaded.
Run Backman on Kubernetes Deploying and running Backman on Kubernetes has gotten fairly straightforward these days.</description></item><item><title>Automatic database backups with Backman</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/database-backups-with-backman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 11:17:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/database-backups-with-backman/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big fan of using Postgres as my main database backend for all my applications, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also always been paranoid about losing data and the need for backups. So when I started pushing my applications onto the Swisscom Application Cloud and attaching Postgres databases to them (hosted by ElephantSQL), I needed a way to ensure there will always be backups, that they are under my control and supervision and hosted externally / off-site from the Postgres-provider itself, preferably on an S3 object store.</description></item></channel></rss>
