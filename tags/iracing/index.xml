Telemetry data is not working? Oh no, after I finally got everything up and running I discovered a major problem. You see, iRacing has 2 different output modes for telemetry data. It can be in either 60hz mode (the default) or in an increased 360hz mode (providing more accurate, albeit somewhat interpolated data). The problem I discovered though was that the majority of my software that I already was using to read telemetry data and do useful things with it, like simulating wind / air flow via Arduino-controlled fans or control bass-shakers to simulate vibrations and road texture, was operating in 60hz mode only.</description></item></channel></rss>
