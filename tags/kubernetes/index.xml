So when I started pushing my applications onto the Swisscom Application Cloud and attaching Postgres databases to them (hosted by ElephantSQL), I needed a way to ensure there will always be backups, that they are under my control and supervision and hosted externally / off-site from the Postgres-provider itself, preferably on an S3 object store.</description></item><item><title>Using a Service Broker in Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 11:23:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>OSBAPI? The Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) is a specification that defines a common language for service providers that your cloud native applications can use to manage cloud services without lockin.
OSBAPI allows independent software vendors, service providers and developers to easily integrate and consume services for workloads running on cloud native platforms such as the Swisscom Application Cloud, which is based on Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. The specification describes a simple set of API endpoints which can be used to provision, access and manage various service offerings, and has been adopted by many different platforms and thousands of service providers by now.</description></item></channel></rss>
