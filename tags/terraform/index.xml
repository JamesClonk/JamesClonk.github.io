It can be used for any cloud-native workload, bare metal or hypervisor, public, private or multi-cloud environments. It allows you to abstract your phyiscal network and to create and define networks for your workloads entirely in software.
One of the features in NSX-T is the so-called &amp;ldquo;Distributed Firewall&amp;rdquo; (DFW), with which you can configure firewall rules for all your east-west traffic inside an NSX-T network.</description></item></channel></rss>
