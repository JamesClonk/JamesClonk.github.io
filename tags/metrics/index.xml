A Cloud Foundry story Loggregator The Loggregator in Cloud Foundry is the system behind the scenes that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for gathering and streaming logs and metrics about user apps. It also gathers and streams metrics from Cloud Foundry components itself and health metrics from other platform VMs. Loggregator allows you to view these logs and metrics either through the Loggregator CF-CLI plugins or through various third-party services and consumers, like for example the Cloud-Controller (API), a Firehose Nozzle or a Log-Cache endpoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
