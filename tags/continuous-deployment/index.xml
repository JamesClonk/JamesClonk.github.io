On my journey where I was (unfortunately) forced to migrate from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes, I first went with a &amp;ldquo;Managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service&amp;rdquo; offering. You can read about that here.
But it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for problems and issues to start emerging. The cluster not being on exactly the version I wanted it to be, pre-installed components that didn&amp;rsquo;t behave they way I wanted (nginx ingress controller for example), price hikes and occasional outages, not really a lot of insight into the behind the scenes of my cluster, etc.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration with Concourse</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/continuous-integration-with-concourse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 19:22:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/continuous-integration-with-concourse/</guid><description>Concourse - the continuous thing-doer edit @ 2020.12.01 These days there are many different platforms and systems out there that can be used to automate all your CI/CD needs.
