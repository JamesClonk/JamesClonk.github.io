My requirements for this have been the following:
Simple and easy to use (I hate complicated UI editors!) Preferably Markdown or similar format support Open source Self-hosted Easily runnable on my personal K8s cluster Tucked away behind an Ingress-Nginx controller, it must not try to do its own TLS / HTTPS handling Preferably no need for a database If it needs to have a database, then it must be Postgres (as that is what I already manage on my K8s infrastructure) Secure Preferably written in Golang PHP based software is out of the question by default!</description></item></channel></rss>
