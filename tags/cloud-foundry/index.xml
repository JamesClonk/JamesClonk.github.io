More specifically you want to restrict access to them only for certain IPs.
Luckily for you Cloud Foundry has a feature that can do exactly that (and much more!): Route-Services
Route-Services? Route-services allow you to apply transformation or preprocessing of HTTP requests before they reach a target application.</description></item><item><title>Automatic database backups with Backman</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/database-backups-with-backman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 11:17:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/database-backups-with-backman/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big fan of using Postgres as my main database backend for all my applications, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also always been paranoid about losing data and the need for backups. So when I started pushing my applications onto the Swisscom Application Cloud and attaching Postgres databases to them (hosted by ElephantSQL), I needed a way to ensure there will always be backups, that they are under my control and supervision and hosted externally / off-site from the Postgres-provider itself, preferably on an S3 object store.</description></item><item><title>Using a Service Broker in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 11:23:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/using-a-service-broker-in-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>OSBAPI? The Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) is a specification that defines a common language for service providers that your cloud native applications can use to manage cloud services without lockin.
OSBAPI allows independent software vendors, service providers and developers to easily integrate and consume services for workloads running on cloud native platforms such as the Swisscom Application Cloud, which is based on Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. The specification describes a simple set of API endpoints which can be used to provision, access and manage various service offerings, and has been adopted by many different platforms and thousands of service providers by now.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Foundry and Prometheus</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/cloud-foundry-and-prometheus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:40:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/cloud-foundry-and-prometheus/</guid><description>Where are my metrics? A Cloud Foundry story Loggregator The Loggregator in Cloud Foundry is the system behind the scenes that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for gathering and streaming logs and metrics about user apps. It also gathers and streams metrics from Cloud Foundry components itself and health metrics from other platform VMs. Loggregator allows you to view these logs and metrics either through the Loggregator CF-CLI plugins or through various third-party services and consumers, like for example the Cloud-Controller (API), a Firehose Nozzle or a Log-Cache endpoint.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Tasks in Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/scheduling-tasks-in-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:23:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/scheduling-tasks-in-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>The Task-Scheduler service on the Swisscom Application Cloud allows you to schedule and automatically run tasks for your applications. You can use it to schedule periodical execution of any tasks on the Application Cloud, including database migrations, emails, batch jobs, etc.
What are Tasks? While most of the time you are probably using the Swisscom Application Cloud (A managed Cloud Foundry platform-as-a-service) to push long running processes or &amp;ldquo;apps&amp;rdquo; as they are commonly called, there is the occasional use case for tasks.</description></item><item><title>Container Networking with Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/container-networking-with-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2018 16:06:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/container-networking-with-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>Container-to-Container Networking on the Swisscom Application Cloud allows for secure and fast direct TCP and UDP communication between your applications. And thanks to its built in Application Service Discovery your app containers will easily be able to locate each other.
The Swisscom Application Cloud uses the open-source distribution of Cloud Foundry to provide you with a managed platform-as-a-service. Ever since the platforms official release we&amp;rsquo;ve continually been adding and implementing new features, and one of these is the Container-to-Container Networking.</description></item><item><title>TCP-Routing on Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/tcp-routing-on-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2018 10:33:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/tcp-routing-on-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>The Swisscom Application Cloud, which is based on the open source industry standard Cloud Foundry, offers an exciting new feature for its users. TCP routing, the ability to support and expose any TCP-based, non-HTTP application to the world. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a closer look and learn how to use TCP routing.
The Swisscom Application Cloud is based on Cloud Foundry, the leading open source industry standard for building your own platform-as-a-service.</description></item><item><title>Docker and Cloud Foundry</title><link>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/docker-and-cloud-foundry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 14:35:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jamesclonk.io/posts/docker-and-cloud-foundry/</guid><description>Cloud Foundry is the open source industry standard for a Platform-as-a-Service.
